Hi there, thank you for downloading this CSS! This will walk you through
how to set this up in your journal.

This CSS was designed by Sketched-Dreams, and tweaked and coded by Spud100.

Note:
This CSS is only meant for your personal use, this does NOT mean you can change 
the images and call it your own. Please use it fairly and give credit in your
journal entry to the creators.

**Setting up your journal**

Open up the CSS notepad document included in the zip, and copy its contents to
the CSS text box in your 'edit journal' page.

Type up your journal, no extra tags are required for the basic format.

Submit.

**Adding Extras**

This CSS contains several extras to make your journal look awesome.
>> ALL OF THESE CODES MUST GO IN THE BODY SECTION FOR THE JOURNAL TO LOOK
THE WAY IT SHOULD. <<

Titles:
Use the code <div class="title">Your Text Here</div> to get a header image to
display the text in the tags.

Stampbox:
Use the code <div class="stampbox">:thumb1234567:</div> for a box beneath the
journal displaying your stamps. Replace the thumbnail codes with the stamps you
want.

Tab Links:
This one requires three codes, and is much more tricky.
For the first tab, use <div class="taba"><a href="URL HERE">Link Text</a></div>
For the second, use <div class="tabb"><a href="URL HERE">Link Text</a></div>
For the third, use <div class="tabc"><a href="URL HERE">Link Text</a></div>


Enjoy the CSS! Any questions or difficulties can be sent to me, Spud100.
